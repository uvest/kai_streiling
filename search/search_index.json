My favourite stupid example is the following:  Imagine you drive a car or bike and stand at a red traffic light.

Here, we were looking at standing people. Yep, mostly their task was to stand still.  Ok, sometimes we told them to only stand still on one leg. Or we told them to walk a couple of meters. Maybe we we also let them do that in VR (virtual reality). And yeah, we might have played around with their senses and showed them weird visual stuff or vibrated parts of their body in response to their standing while they had to do just that: stand still.</p> <p>So, together with my colleagues Celine and Max we had a look at what is called multisensory-integration for balance control and gait. These projects were somewhat aimed at the question how we combine information from multiple sources, such as our eyes (vision), our body (feeling where our hand is without looking at it: proprioception) or our skin (if there is a vibrator sticked to it), to move around in our world or - yeah - stand still. That question becomes especially interesting when either something is off, e.g. when our visual information does not fit our proprioception, or when there is something new, e.g. when we get vibrational feedback about how we stand.</p>"},{"location":"research/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>For an up-to date list please rather look at my google scholar page.</p>"},{"location":"research/#paper","title":"Paper","text":"<ul> <li>Streiling, K., Sch\u00fclke, R., Straube, B. et al.

It is often described as \"the feeling of being in control, of being the source of ones thoughts, actions and their consequences.\" And equivalent to many feelings, we mostly don't notice Agency when we think, move or interact.</p> <p>One well-known model about the source of this feeling of being in control is the comparator-model. This model works on the assumption that we constantly make predictions about our body and our world around us. Especially when we act, we feed a copy of the efferece signal (which we send to our muscles to move them) into a feed-forward model. This feed-forward model then predicts not only the outcome of this action, the resulting state, but also the corresponding sensory consequences: When I touch the hot oven, it will hurt.  This predicted sensory consequence is then compared to what we actually sense. If they match, we feel Agency and everything goes as expected.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Agency/#the-mario-cart-effect","title":"The Mario-Cart Effect","text":"<p>Think of the first time you played Mario Cart with some other people - potentially your friends.

Outside people pass by minding their daily business, some with sour Monday morning looks on their faces and medium-bad coffee in their to-go cups, some with their gaze drilled into their smartphones and their ears plugged by little white antennas connecting them to cyber space.  Suddenly you observe one of the latter species with only 3 of their 5 senses intact walking straight towards a representant of the first species standing around, looking at their watch and taking a sip of their black gold. Of course the one bumps into the other, who stumbles and even sends their coffee flying.  If you were now asked what happened you'd immediately say something that boils down to person A bumped into person B who then stumbled. You immediately understood the direction of causality and the resulting effect, that is the cause-effect relation.</p> <p>What you have just observed could be called a \"human launching event\", leaning on the broken down visual stimuli that we usually use in the lab. These stimuli are controlled for every little aspect and thus often very simplistic, such as the ones we have used in this study:</p> <p>We (that is my colleagues from Marburg) have shown these stimuli to our participants and asked them whether they perceived the event as causal or non-causal.  \"Well, that's obvious\", you might think. And yes it is, so we added a delay and an angle to the red disk's movement to make it wait a bit after the contact and to make it move not in a straight path.  It has already been shown that adding these implausibilities reduces the average perceived causality, so people report events with a big delay less often as causal. However, even if there is a very big delay or a very big angle, some trials are still rated as causal, i.e. causality does not vanish completely.  There are many reasons why the causal impression of such a simple event never fully disappears. For example I believe human imagination could play a role: Maybe the participants just imagine these dots to be two people in a crowded street bumping into each other. And suddenly, in this context, these doesn't need to be a straight path to make the event causally plausible.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/#dependent-rouelette-gambling","title":"Dependent Rouelette Gambling","text":"<p>The aspect we investaged in our study though, was more tangible: We wondered whether a causality judgement a participant made in one trial had an effect on their next answer. The simple answer to this question is Yes. Though it would hardly be science, if we'd stop here and didn't wonder about the how.</p> <p>Now, let me motivate the how with another little story.</p> <p>My friends and I have somewhat built up a tradition over the last years. Before christmas, we all dress up in the fanciest suits we can find in our cupboards, attach a vintage bow tie, have a Gl\u00fchwein on the christmas market and head for the the casino. Some of us winning, most of us loosing, but all feeling fancy and having fun.  What caught my eye on one of those evenings was the betting behaviour at the Roulette tables. Many bet on either black or red (both having on average a 48.6 % chance). Sometimes, a table spat out the same colour again and again, all black for the last 10, 15, 20 draws. Such is chance. Funnily however, if such sequences occur, more and more people are drawn to the opposite color. They are clearly influenced by the past outcomes of the gamble although there is no information in it - unless some trick is at work. Such is human nature.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/#causality-an-schizophrenia","title":"Causality an Schizophrenia","text":"<p>So far I tried to give an intuition about the how (methods) and the what (research question). Let me also motivate the the who (research population).  Maybe the question how previous decisions influence our current choices is already interesting for the general population. But my colleagues in Marburg, however, are focussed on a special population, patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD). People with SSD can have problems with perceiving cause-effect relations. For example, not registering the relation between an intention and a movement can lead to the delusion that their hand moved on their own.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/#putting-it-all-together-and-giving-some-answers","title":"Putting it all together... and giving some answers","text":"<p>Now, that was a long way to simply explain the research question:</p> <p>\"What is the influence of past events and decisions on perceived causality judgements in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder?\"</p> <p>Let's be quicker with the results.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Yes, past decisions have a direct influence on current causality judgements. We generally tend to stick to the same answer we gave previously, that is, if we said \"causal\" in the previous trial, we are now more likely to also say \"causal\", independent of what is actually going on in the event. Same the other way around, for saying \"non causal\". Interestingly, this bias was on average not much different between our two groups of healthy people and people with SSD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of course, a causal judgement is also influenced by the delay and angle of the current event. Here it was interesting, that our healthy control group put more importance on the delay and the group with SSD more importance on the angle. What do I mean with importance? A look at Figure 2 can help. SSDs, for example, reported on average more causality for a direct path than healthy control, but less causality for a path with 60 \u00b0 angle of egress. They were more influenced by the spatial information (angle) than their healthy control counterparts. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Now, it would be a bit boring if that was all we found though.</p> <ol> <li>It gets more interesting when we look at how this choice-bias interacts with the angle and delay of the current event. Long story short: If what we currently observe is ambuguous, we just use our previous choice as a fall-back. Have a look at Figure 3!</li> <li>And finally, we took a look at how these influences of angle, delay and past choices develop over time. Leaning on the story above you can ask, how does your betting behaviour change over the evening? At least for our launching events, the bias of the previous choice went down for healthy controls, but increased for our SSD population! We argued that potentially, HCs learnt the scope of the experiment (range of angles and delays that were possible) over time and were better able to place a single event into the context of what they learnt. SSDs on the other hand, couldn't.</li> </ol> <p>You can find more detailed answers (and nice figures) in the paper we published on this in 2025:  \"Choice- and trial-history effects on causality perception in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder\"</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/#too-long-didnt-read","title":"Too long, didn't read","text":"<p>tl;dr  We use Michotte Launching events to study the judgements of perceptual causality in healthy controls and schizophrenic patients.

We can even focus on one sense, blend out others, trust or distrust them, or rely on just a subset of them. And most intriguingly, we do so without much mental effort. This skill becomes especially important when our senses don't match up anymore.  One situation where this seamless integration breaks, at least for a few moments, is the visuomotor \"moving room illusion\". Imagine yourself sitting inside a train at a trainstation, looking out of the window at another train (trainception). What happens when that other train starts moving? Most likely you will briefly think that it is your train that (finally) started moving.</p> <p>A more artificial version of a literally moving room was already used in experiments in the 70s showing that people rely heavily on their visual input for keeping balance. This visual dominance also causes us problems, when the visual information is incongruent with information from our proprioceptive and vestibular system.</p> <p>While I won't ask why we have this visual dominance in the first place, I wonder how we robustly integrate vision and other senses when they disagree with each other.

As you might guess, we use that inverted pendulum as a very crude approimation of a human standing.</p> <p>The magic we added was in the combination and adaptation of the state estimates that we got from a proprioceptive and a visual input stream.  The combination we made dependent on the estimated noise of each stream: The less reliable an input stream was estimated to be, the less weight was placed on it.  And these noise variance estimates we then adapted over time, depending on if a predicted observation matched with the actual observation of each stream. (See right side of the poster above.)</p> <p>Here, we can also strike a link to Agency. A famous model for the Sense of Agency - at least in the sensorimotor context - is the comparator model. If what we expect to observe/ sense/ perceive based on an acion we made fits with what we actually observe/ sense/ perceive, we feel agency about the result. If not, well, then we don't. Here we use this same idea to update our noise estimates and shift the weighting between different input streams: If we feel no Agency about the results in one input stream, we increase its estimated noise.
