# Research Interests

My research rotates around the [Sense of Agency](#agency) in humans and machines. <br>
I've also dipped my toes a bit into [Mutlisensory Integration](#multisensory-control) for movement control, particularly when these senses provide conflicting information, e.g. in visuomotor illusions.

## Agency

A sense of Agency can be thought of as understanding/ sensing/ feeling that some event was caused by you or one of your action. My favourite stupid example is the following: <br>
Imagine you drive a car or bike and stand at a red traffic light. When you snap your fingers just at the right time (and with the right intention) and the traffic light turns green, you'll have the feeling and childish satisfaction that it was you that made it turn green.

With that very intuitive idea about the Sense of Agency in mind, let me tell you a bit more about it:

* [The sticky perception of causality and Schizophrenia](./blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History.md)
* [Measuring Agency - The Mario-Cart Effect: It's a me!? ... or is it?](./blog/Agency.md)
<!-- * Optimal Control model of Agency and confusion
* Agency in Deep-Reinforcement Learning for multi-agent tasks -->

## Multisensory Control

* [Multisensory balance control for humans, optimal controllers and Deep-RL agents](./blog/Multisensory_balance.md)
